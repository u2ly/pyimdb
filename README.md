# pyimdb

Python PoC implementation of some mobile API (potentially a faster alternative to web scraping).

## Tests

While I'd ideally love to write unit tests (jk), doing so would ofc violate someones Conditions of Use, so can't do that. On this note, the whole code is untested and may contain bugs or errors that I'm not aware of because I ofc can't test it (would violate their CoU, you feel me?).
